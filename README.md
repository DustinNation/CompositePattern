# CompositePattern
Head First Design Patterns Chapter 9 Part 2

The Composite Pattern allows us to build structures of objects in the form of trees that contain both compositions of objects, as well as individual objects as nodes.

Using a composite structure, we can apply the same operations over both composites and individual objects. In other words, in most cases we can ignore the differences between compositions of objects and individual objects.
